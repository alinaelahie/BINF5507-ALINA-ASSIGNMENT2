Heart Disease Prediction: Regression and Classification Models
Objective:
The goal of this is to:

1. Train and evaluate machine learning models for both regression and classification tasks.
3. Visualize and interpret the effects of hyperparameters.
2. Reflect on the model selection process and derive insights from the results.

Project Structure:
1. The dataset used for training the models is: Data/heart_disease_uci.csv
2. Jupyter notebook containing both regression and classification models is: main.ipynb in scripts folder 
3. Documentation for the project is in: README.md

Dataset:
The Heart Disease Dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about various factors such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, which can be used to predict the presence of heart disease.

Features: Age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and others.



How to Run the Code:
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the scripts directory and open main.ipynb in Jupyter or any compatible notebook editor.
3. Make sure to install necessary libraries using pip:
4. Run the notebook cell-by-cell to see the process of model training, evaluation, and visualization.
